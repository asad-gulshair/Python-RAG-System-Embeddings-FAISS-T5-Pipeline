SimpleRAG is a clean, minimal, and easy-to-understand implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using:

Sentence Transformers (MPNet) for embedding text

FAISS for vector similarity search

FLAN-T5 for generating answers based on retrieved context

Python / Google Colab for quick experimentation

This project is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand how RAG systems work internally, without heavy frameworks or complex architecture.
